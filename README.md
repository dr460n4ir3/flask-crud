This application is a work in progress.

So far it is a simple flask app that is able to read and display data from a file called 'data.py'.

In the futer the app will pull from  a SQL database.

I will later add user authetication.

Once the UI and basic setup of the website is done then I will ad the secound component.

I will try to not use any fontend frameworks if possible.

The project is currently only uses HTML & CSS if needed I might play around with HTMX.

I will add a web scraper to collect data and store in our DB.

I want to add a chatbot interface that connects to my local ollama model.

Finally the goal is to combine everything together for on big project.

Finished product will allow users to input normal langualge as text then the model will convert it tho sql and search our DB for relevent data.

This is nothing new but a challanging task and something of intrest to help me sharpen my skills.

NOTE: the requirement.txt is inflated at the moment but only flask was installed.
